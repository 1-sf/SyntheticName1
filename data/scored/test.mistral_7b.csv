However, the abstract concepts of ""time periods"" are not entities, so ""Early Period"" is not an entity. Instead, it is a description of a specific point in Assyrian history. Similarly, ""Old Assyrian Empire,"" ""Middle Assyrian Empire,"" and ""Neo-Assyrian Empire"" are entities, but they are historical entities that represent distinct eras in Assyrian history.","[21, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 41, 42, 42, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 41, 42, 42, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 41, 42, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
